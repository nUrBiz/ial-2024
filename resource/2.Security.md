# Security

We are gonna try to disable services on Cassiopea.

# Setting up

The ICMP protocol is enabled in the AWS security groups to enable capture it.  

From an on-premise machine, enable public IP address running indefinitely, sending:
```
ping -t ipOfCassiopea
```

- BRUTE FORCE ATTACK  

Using Ubuntu, you can simply install it with the following command as it is available in the official repository:  
```
apt install hydra
```
using the dictionary “rockyou.txt”, by sending the following command of penetration attempt, we will choose the protocol used to connect to the machine in EC2, so ssh:  
```
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt ipCassiopea protocol
```
and the page of the Test Site is kept open in Cassiopeia

# BLUE team  

- FAIL2BAN
    
    - Let's install the fail2ban service on the Cassiopeia machine:  

```
apt install fail2ban
```

on-premise monitoring is performed on ```/var/log/fail2ban.log```.


- CASE A (Fail2ban disabled)
    - In my case I only managed to get some higher latency of reachability on the Cassiopeia machine, but I did not finish the DOWN of the service even if i had few protocols available on which to make substantial attempts.

- CASE B (Fail2ban enabled)
    - I was only able to perform simple monitoring as shown in the following photo, identifying and _JAILING_ the address of origin:
